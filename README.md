This project focuses on solidifying my understanding of several key JavaScript concepts:

* Event Handlers: Mastering how to capture user interactions (clicks, key presses, etc.) and execute corresponding code to create a dynamic user experience.

* Array Methods: Leveraging built-in array methods like forEach, map, filter, reduce, and timers to manipulate and process data efficiently within arrays.

What I Gained:

* Enhanced Event Handling: By implementing event handlers, I practiced responding to user actions and controlling the program's behavior accordingly.

* Array Manipulation Expertise: Exploring various array methods allowed me to iterate over arrays, transform elements, filter specific content, and perform calculations to achieve desired outcomes.

* Practical Application: This project provided a hands-on environment to combine these concepts and build interactive features or processes that utilize arrays and user interactions.

Feel free to:

Dive into the code to see how event handlers and array methods are implemented.
Fork the repository and experiment with different functionalities using these concepts.
Share your thoughts, questions, or suggestions for improvement!
